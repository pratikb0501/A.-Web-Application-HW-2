# A.-Web-Application-HW-2

## 1. Fedex tracking App (4pt)
- Build a simple Fedex tracking App.
- Use constant declaration for this tracking number, 582734098
- Use $_GET method to realize this.
- Use ternary operator ( ? : ) to see if the input value is equal to the tracking number.
- It needs to give error in case there is a input other than a number.
- Upload fedex.php to Bb by zipping it and 000webhost and provide the 000webhost
address.
- Please add a screenshot of your desktop including your name.

## 2. Task List App upgrade (6pt)
- Download the App files from the Bb (Blackboard).
- This is a Task List App, and you can add and delete a task.
- Please have a look at the code and try to understand each line. Looking into other’s code
is a great practice to enhance your programming skills.
- For now, if you click “Add Task” button, it will add a new task at the end of the task list.
- Change the code so that it adds a new task at the beginning of the task list in FIFO way
when you click “Add Task” button. You might want to find a PHP array function instead of
writing a new function (3pt).
- Add “Remove Task” button next to the “Add Task” button. Add code so that this new button
removes the task at the top (FIFO) (3pt).
